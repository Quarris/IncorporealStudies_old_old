Entry:

Souls have various types. Although each body can have only one soul (As far as I have observed), each soul does actually have a capability to be of different types simultaneously. This concept allows me to enhance a body's soul with that of another by transferring it.

Soul Types
==========

Clear:
    A clear soul is one which is empty (not to be confused with a vacuum). This type of soul contain no emotion and no physical existence in the real world. I can store a clear soul for future use and can be obtained by clearing all the soul types from within it.

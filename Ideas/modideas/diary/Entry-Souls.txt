Pre-Reqs:



Entry:

I have recently been studying the concept of souls and have found numerous examples present in the real world.
Every living body contains a soul, and every lifeless body contains a soul vacuum.
I have found a soul vacuum in both animate and inanimate lifeless bodies.
Animate creatures with a soul vacuum I will call Soulless.
Souls cannot be created, nor destroy, they can only be transfer from one body to another.

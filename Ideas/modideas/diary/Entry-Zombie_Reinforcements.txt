Pre-Reqs:



Entry:

Recently I have seen the soulless manage to create reinforcements to aid their help when they are being attacked.
This is a plausible scenario for the soulless as they do not require to create souls to populate the newly created body.
I wonder if I can study those soulless creatures and use their trait for myself.

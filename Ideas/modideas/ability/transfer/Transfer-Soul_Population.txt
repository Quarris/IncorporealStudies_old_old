Entry:

After looking into populating the soul vacuum I have discovered the ability to fill a soul vacuum with that of another.
There are various uses where that can come in useful, one such notable case is turning a Zombie Villager back into a Living Villager.
Though the not every soul type has the same effect on a vacuum, and not every body will benefit from having their vacuum populated, I am sure that I can use this knowledge to benefit my studies.

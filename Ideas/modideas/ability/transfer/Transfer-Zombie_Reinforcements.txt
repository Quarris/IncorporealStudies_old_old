Entry:

I DID IT! I managed to create a ritual to call in reinforcements of the soulless in the same manner as they do.
*Now if I get hit I have a chance of spawning the soulless to aid my help*. I cannot make the last long however, they will *despawn* shortly after their target dies.
Also there seems to be a limit as to how many soulless can aid me at once.

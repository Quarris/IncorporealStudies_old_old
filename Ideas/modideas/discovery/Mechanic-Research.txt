Research an existing discovery to learn more about it and potentially unlocking abilities in the process.

Research consists of several steps:
    1) Once the research entry is unlocked in the Diary the tasks are automatically detected.
    2) Complete a list of tasks
        2.1) Tasks are provided in the Diary once the research has started.
        2.2) Tasks can be anything from looking at something to clicking on mob to having an item.
        2.3) Completing the tasklist allows the player to create research notes
    3) Finalise Research
        3.1) Create research notes for a specific discovery.
            3.1.1) Can only be created if notes are not in inv.
            3.1.2) Notes are bound to a player (maybe you should work on your handwriting so others can read your work)
        3.2) Use notes in a research table and clues from the Diary entry to unlock the research.
        3.3) Unlock the research (by R-Clicking and only by the bound player)

Research can be copied by sharing Translation Notes crafted by a player, and RClicking by the learner. Afterwards the
player wanting to learn can RClick the other players Diary to learn its contents.

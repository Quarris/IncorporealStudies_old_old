Find discoveries in the world by observing the natural world.
Observations are written into the Diary.
They provide knowledge about the many phenomenon of the world.

Observations happen without the need of the player to do anything and are automatically written to the Diary.
If a player does something where an observation activates then it will.
Observations only can happen if the player has the Diary and Research Utensils in inventory.

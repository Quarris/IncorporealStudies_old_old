Incorporeal Studies, the idea of study, transfer and manipulation of souls.

Involves 4 main aspects:
    -Discovery (Split into Observation and Research)

    -Knowledge
    -Transfer
    -Manipulation


            Discovery
======================================
Discoveries can be made in 2 ways; Observation and Research

Observations are things found in the real world which you may find extraordinary.

Research allows you to discover phenomenon by collecting your mind in quiet.

Studying souls allows one to unlock new discovery which will aid in the progress of discovering new incorporeal phenomenon.
Discoveries are written to the Diary which can help to collect and share data on souls as well as recall information
that what may have been forgotten.

              Knowledge
======================================
Knowledge increases ones perception of the world, allowing them to understand various souls without the need to use specialised tools.
This also helps the researcher with cognitive and sensory tasks, allowing them to sense the world around them in a way a normal person
wouldn't, granting them passive abilities.


               Transfer
======================================
The transfer of souls allows the user to enhance their own souls or the soul of another.
Transfers require a ritual which will vary depending on the souls being used.
May cause undesirable effects.


             Manipulation
======================================
One can master manipulating of souls in such a way as to command life itself to their own benefit.
This allows the manipulator to use souls within others to manipulate their behaviour.

Manipulation also gives the ability to give souls to the soulless, be it a animate or inanimate.


                Souls
======================================
Every soul is different. Various types may share common features but the quantity of life or use each soul has can vary.
Everything in the world, be it animate or inanimate, has either a soul, or a soul vacuum. A Soul can be extracted, rendering the
object useless... or dead (Other possible consequences may be in place). A soul vacuum can become populated if one provides it with a soul;
Not all soulless object can benefit from having their vacuum become populated by a soul, and each every soul may have a different,
possibly undesired effects on the object.

Entities can have multiple types of souls in them each type can also have different amount, together adding up to a 100%.
This means that a body can be seperated into percentages of soul types.
